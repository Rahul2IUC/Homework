 *06-08-2019     Problem: Bubble Sort Algorithm*
----------------------------------------------------------
I have studied how the bubble sort algorithm works.
                what i learned:
                * To find the the time complexity of this algorithm,i.e O(n2).
	            * I Understood how the space complexity of this algorithim is O(1).

 *07-08-2019     Problem: INSERTION Sort Algorithm*
----------------------------------------------------------
I have studied how the insertion sort algorithm works.
                what i learned:
                * To find the the time complexity of this algorithm,i.e O(n2).
	            * I Understood how the space complexity of this algorithim is O(1).
	            * Best case for insertion sort is O(n-1).
